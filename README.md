# Uncommon Python Bug: Implicit Type Conversion and Exception Handling

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to implicit type conversion and exception handling in Python. The `function_with_uncommon_error` function handles the case where `a` is 0 correctly. However, it does not explicitly handle the `ZeroDivisionError` when `b` is 0, resulting in unexpected behavior. The implicit return of `a` when `b` is 0 is an uncommon and potentially confusing behavior.

The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code, while the `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version with explicit exception handling. This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling in Python to ensure robust and predictable code.
